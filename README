This was pulled together over years of using vim and what I like to use.  
I have borrowed things from a ton of repos to get some stuff working with Yabai etx., 

## Details 
- I run a Lulu keyboad by BoardSource, with a custom mapping running Colemak DHm.
- Yabai / SKHD for window management.
- Kitty for terminal with Catppuccin theme. 
- Neovim, kickstart, nvim-autopairs, formatter.nvim, lualine, neogit, neotree,
  nvim-surround, catppuccin theme, vimtest and yanky. 
  - Leader is ','.
  - which key is installed as well to help.
  - There are also some telescope commands to find rails specific files in dirs.
- tmux with catppuccin theme. 
- homebrew - which also has a brewfile where you can use `brew bundle` to
  install and keep things up to date.

## Optional
- Hide the menu bar and dock in the Desktop & Dock settings. 
	- Also ensure only 'switch to Space with open windows for application' under Mission Control.
- Setup Mission Control and add 6 desktops.
	- Remove animation and set shortcuts for desktops.
		- Accessibility, Display, Reduce Motion
	- Keyboard, Shortcuts, Mission Control, check all of Mission Controls.


NOTE: You will also see in my kitty config, I use ComicCode or Monolisa, you
can replace this with any font you wish.  These are pay fonts and are not 
included in this repo. 

## Install

- Clone repo and then link .config to your ~/.config directory.
- Update .gitconfig for username etc.
- Update/create .gemrc, .npmrc etc.

1. Install Prezto as intended.
	https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto
2. Symlink .zshenv to home dir.
3. Add ```zstyle ':prezto:module:prompt' theme 'powerlevel10k'``` to your .zpreztorc
4. Run `p10k configure` to configure your shell prompt.

- Things should auto install with Lazy, but if not , use :Lazy
  - If there is an issue, rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim and ~/.cache/nvim folders
  - Then recompile / install.
